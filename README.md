## Usage

The app consists of a counter initialized to 10. You can increment or decrement the counter using the provided buttons.

## Code Overview

Here's the main part of the code that handles the counter logic:

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react'
import reactLogo from './assets/react.svg'
import viteLogo from '/vite.svg'
import './App.css'

function App() {
 let [value, setValue] = useState(10)

 const add = () => {
   setValue(prevValue => prevValue + 1)
   console.log("Value is added and current value is", value)
 }

 const sub = () => {
   setValue(prevValue => prevValue - 1)
   console.log("Value is subtracted and current value is", value)
 }

 return (
   <div className='counterbg'>
     <h1>THIS IS A COUNTER APP</h1>
     <h2>THE CURRENT VALUE: {value}</h2>
     <button onClick={add}>CLICK THIS BUTTON TO ADD BY 1</button>
     <br />
     <br />
     <button onClick={sub}>CLICK THIS BUTTON TO SUB BY 1</button>
   </div>
